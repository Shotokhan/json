This is very simple and very powerful JSON parser. It creates DOM-like data structure and allows to iterate and process JSON objects very simple way.
It does not alloc any memory for JSON itself, it only allocs memory for tokens. It also does not use recursive way to build data structure which makes it very fast to build DOM-like tree structure.

#### Documentation

Almost all functions (inline versions) and parameters are documented inside related headers. <br />
Complete documentation: http://json.readthedocs.io

## Features

- header-only or optional compiled library
- option to store members and arrays as reverse order or normal
- doesn't alloc memory for keys and values only for tokens
- creates DOM-like data structure to make it easy to iterate though
- simple api
- provides some util functions to print json, get int32, int64, float, double...
- very small library


#### Important Note for Arrays

- **json_array_t** inherits **json_t**, so you can cast **json_array_t** to **json_t**. It only adds **count** member.
- The **value** link gives array's childen (last element if you set `reverse` to true)
- Every item of **json_array_t** is **json_t**. You can get integer, float or boolean values from that object. The **next** link of that object is next item of that object in array.

#### Important Note for keys and values

- json doesn't copy keys and values, it only gives pointers to key and values. So when compaing keys or copying values, you must use keySize or valSize. Or you can use builtin inline functions.

## TODOs

- [ ] ignore comments?
- [x] provide header only library and optionally compile version
- [x] provide option to preserve array order (currently array order is reversed, because it is easy to parse it in this way; this may be changed. Please follow new commits or releases)
- [x] windows build
- [ ] cmake?
- [ ] tests
- [ ] extra optimizations
- [x] documentation
- [ ] usage in detail

## Build

### Unix (Autotools)

```bash
sh autogen.sh
./configure
make
[sudo] make install
```

you can grap library in .libs folder after build finished

### Windows (MSBuild)

Windows related build files, project files are located in `win` folder,
make sure you are inside `tm/win` folder.
Code Analysis are enabled, it may take awhile to build

```Powershell
cd win
.\build.bat
```

### Cmake

todo.

### Header-only or Compiled Library

The functions has the `jsonc_` prefix are compiled version which is called from library. To use this feature you must include `json/call/json.h` header.

To use header-only library you must include `json/json.h` header. The functions has the `json_` prefix are forced to be inlined. When you use this, you don't have to compile the library.

todo.

#### Example usage

You can inspect `json_print()` to view usage in more detail. The example will be updated later to give more detail.

```C
#include <json/json.h>
#include <json/print.h>

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
  json_doc_t *doc;
  json_t     *root;
  
  doc  = json_parse(/* JSON string */);
  root = doc->root;

  json_print(root);

  json_free(doc);

  return 0;
}

```

```C

const json_doc_t *jsonDoc;
const json_t         *json;

jsonDoc = json_parse(/* JSON string */);
json    = jsonDoc->root->value;

/* already defined in util.h */
JSON_INLINE
bool
json_key_eq(const json_t * __restrict obj, const char * __restrict str) {
  return strncmp(str, obj->key, obj->keySize) == 0;
}

while (json) {
    if (json_key_eq(json, "key 1")) {
      int aNumber;

     aNumber = json_int32(json, 0);

     /* ... */
    } else if (json_key_eq(json, "key 2")) {
      const char *nonNullTerminatedString;
      const char *nullTerminatedString;

      /* just pointer */
      nonNullTerminatedString = json_string(json);

       /* null-terminated string (strdup), needs to be freed */
      nullTerminatedString    = json_string_dup(json);

     /* ... */
    } else if (json_key_eq(json,"key 3")) {
      json_t *aChild;
      
      aChild = json->value;
      while (aChild) {
          /* handle child node */
          aChild = aChild->next;
      }
    }

    json = json->next;
}
```
